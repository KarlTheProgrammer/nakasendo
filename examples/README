## SDKLibraries examples in c++/python/webassembly

The best way to make the examples works is to define the envirnoment variable SDKLIBRARIES_ROOT pointing to the location where SDKLibraries is installed

## C++ examples :
On windows, you'll need Visual Studio C++ 2017 and cmake 3.12 or newer. On linux, you'll need gcc7, cmake 3.12 or newer.
On windows, run the command :
  cmake -G"Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 C:\path\to\example\cpp
It will create the visual studio solution file .sln. Open this file and you can start to compile/run the c++ examples

On Linux (Ubuntu 18.04), run the command :
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/example/cpp ; make -j4
It will create a Makefile project and build it. You can start to compile/run the c++ examples

## Python examples :
If you have defined the variable SDKLIBRARIES_ROOT correctly, just open python files and run it normally.
Otherway is to define the PYTHONPATH variable pointing to the installation of SDKLibraries

## Python examples :
Python examples need to know where to find all the pypthon modules.
If you have defined the variable SDKLIBRARIES_ROOT correctly, just open python files and run it normally.
Otherway is to define the PYTHONPATH variable pointing to the installation of SDKLibraries (where it have all module files) and run it
Note that on windows, if you have a debug version of SDK installation, you should use the python_d interpreter instead of python

## Javascript examples :
To run javascript example, you need a http server. The simplest way is to use python to run the http server.
Open the terminal, go to /location/of/installation/example/javascript, run the comnmand :
python -m http.server
Then from the browser, open localhost:8000
